Please have a look at https://beetl.ai for task information.
There are four tutorials that helps you to get some working pipelins for the two challenges in the BEETL competition.
1. The 'DataGuide' kit helps participants to download and load competition data for training and leaderboard testing.
2. The 'sleep_kit' helps participants to run a 6-class transfer learnig decoding task (like Task1 in BEETL) on our sample sleep data (10 subjects).
3. The 'motor_imagery_kit' helps participants to understand how to use MOABB to download and load the three source data set will be used in Task2, and run a multi-dataset cross-subject transfer learnig decoding task (like Task2 in BEETL).
4. The 'LeaderboardLabelGeneration' kit shows the examples to use trained model to do predictions and save the prediction files in correct format to be uploaded to our leaderboard platform.
